		Date = October 10, 2016 AD
		Format = "Roctal", octal that rocks \m/
		Data Description = ASCII file of United State Constitution(USC)
		Media  = ink on paper
		side = 250 micronsp[0.01 inches], 4Xside = 1 mm[0.04 inches]

	Description:
		File size of USC is 26,821 bytes, each of which is a 7 bit ASCII character
		64X64 character block is 6.4 cm[2.5 inches] X 6.4 cm, 7 blocks required for file
		7 blocks are a subset of an 8 block pattern with two columns and 4 rows
		each 64X64 block shall have a pair of rectangles as alignment marks in each of the 
		four corners, where the upper left corner(corner of the corner) is defined as the local coordinate (0,0),
		where local coordinates are all measured in the unit "side", defined above
		blocks read left to right first then top to bottom

Tale:

	I've been working on this Roctal stuff now for a few weeks, and it's taken many forms. 
	 This is my attempt to make something that is interesting to someone.  I chose the 
	 US Constitution because it's clearly public domain, is a nice length for this format,
	 and should be pretty widely of interest to people in the US at least.  After trying
	 it on paper, hopefully the next step is to do it in gold and silicon as a long term 
	 data storage demo.
